## Learning to Write Screenplays

* Screenwriting is largely a matter of common sense.
* When you have an idea, you need to put it into words to capture the essence of the idea.
* While some scripts are great and others not so great, the key is to get the initial ideas down so you don't forget them.
* This forms the basic skeleton of the script, which can then be developed further.


## The Three-by-Five Card Method

The speaker met Frank Daniels at the American Film Institute, who taught a practical approach to screenwriting.

This method involves using **a pack of three-by-five index cards**:

1. On each card, the writer writes the heading or title of a scene.
2. Once the writer has 70 such scene cards, they have the basic structure of a feature-length screenplay.
3. The writer then fleshes out each of the 70 scenes, and the result is a complete script.


## The Importance of a Structured Approach

The three-by-five card method provides a structured way to develop a screenplay.

It helps the writer capture the key elements of each scene and organize them into a cohesive narrative.

This structured approach makes the screenwriting process more manageable and helps ensure that the final script is well-crafted and effective.


## Conclusion

> Screenwriting, while not overly difficult, requires a systematic approach to ensure the successful translation of an idea into a well-structured, compelling screenplay. The three-by-five card method described in the video offers a practical and effective way for aspiring screenwriters to develop their craft and bring their creative visions to life.
